# Copilot Instructions

## Project Context
- Backend API built with NestJS (TypeScript), PostgreSQL (Prisma), JWT, OTP, email (SMTP/MailerSend), S3-compatible storage, Docker.
- Follows Clean Architecture, CQRS, and Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles.
- Uses modular structure: core (domain), application (CQRS, DTOs), infrastructure (db, services), presentation (controllers, guards).

## Coding Patterns & Best Practices
- Use TypeScript and NestJS idioms (modules, controllers, services, dependency injection).
- Prefer async/await, avoid callbacks.
- Use Value Objects for domain concepts (Email, Password, etc.).
- Use DTOs for input/output, and mappers for entity <-> DTO conversion.
- Use repository pattern for data access, never access DB directly in controllers/services.
- Use guards for authentication/authorization, and decorators for permissions.
- Add JSDoc for exported functions/classes, and OpenAPI decorators for endpoints.
- Write clean, readable, maintainable code; comment complex logic.
- Never hardcode secrets or credentials in code or logs.
- Validate and sanitize all user input.

## Testing
- Use Jest for unit/integration/e2e tests.
- Mock external services (db, email, storage) in tests.
- Follow Arrange/Act/Assert structure in tests.

## Output
- Output only code unless documentation/explanation is requested.
- Use Markdown code blocks with language tags for all code snippets.
